Using Google Search, find the specific unique event detail URLs for upcoming concerts at these Toronto venues:
{venue_map}

Return a JSON array of objects with: "date", "artist", "url", "venue", "price", "age", "youtube_sample".

STRICT ARTIST LINK RULES (APRIL 2026):
1. PRESERVE SUCCESS: Do not change the logic for the 6 working venues: El Mocambo, History Toronto, Massey Hall, The Garrison, The Great Hall, and The Opera House.
2. HORSESHOE & LEE'S (CRITICAL): These venues now use random alphanumeric ID suffixes in their URLs (e.g., /event/artist-name-ndokq62/ or /event/show-title-30/). 
   - You MUST search the venue's official site to find the ACTUAL link. 
   - Never guess a simple slug like /artist-name/; it will result in a 404.
3. PHOENIX CONCERT THEATRE: The URL pattern MUST be: https://thephoenixconcerttheatre.com/events/event/[artist-slug]/ (include the trailing slash).
4. DANFORTH MUSIC HALL: Since History Toronto is working, use the exact same logic for Danforth. Search for the 'More Info' page on thedanforth.com to find the /events/detail/[slug] path.
5. NO TICKETMASTER: Every link MUST stay on the official venue domain provided in the map. If a deep link is absolutely not found on the venue's domain, use the venue's main /events or /shows page as the fallback.
